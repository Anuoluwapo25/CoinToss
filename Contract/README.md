# Main Smart Contract (CoinToss.sol)

## Overview
CoinToss.sol is the main smart contract for TheOnePercent. Users can join pools, participate in multiple rounds of coin toss selections, and compete for a prize pool. The contract manages player participation, enforces game rules, tracks winners, and distributes rewards based on game outcomes.

## Features
- **Pool Creation**: The contract owner can create pools with a defined entry fee and maximum number of participants.
- **Joining Pools**: Players can join pools by paying the required entry fee.
- **Game Rounds**: Players make a selection (HEADS or TAILS) each round.
- **Automatic Round Conclusion**: The contract determines winners based on majority selection, or a random choice in case of a tie.
- **Elimination System**: Players selecting the losing side are eliminated.
- **Final Winners**: The last standing players win the pool prize.
- **Points System**: Players earn points for joining, winning rounds, and winning the final prize.
- **Event Emissions**: The contract emits events for key actions like pool creation, player joining, round completion, and winners' announcements.

## Contract Components

### Enums
- `PlayerChoice`: Represents a player's choice in a round (`NONE`, `HEADS`, `TAILS`).
- `PoolStatus`: Represents the status of a pool (`OPENED`, `ACTIVE`, `CLOSED`).

### Structs
- `Player`: Stores player details including their choice, elimination status, and claim status.
- `Pool`: Stores pool details, player mappings, and round tracking information.
- `PoolInfo`: Provides an overview of a poolâ€™s details.

### Key Variables
- `poolCount`: Tracks the total number of pools.
- `pools`: Mapping of pool ID to `Pool` struct.
- `userPools`: Tracks pools a player has joined.
- `playerPoints`: Tracks players' accumulated points.

## Functions

### Pool Management
- `createPool(uint _entryFee, uint _maxParticipants)`: Creates a new pool.
- `joinPool(uint _poolId)`: Allows a player to join a pool by paying the entry fee.
- `getPoolInfo(uint256 _poolId)`: Retrieves pool details.

### Game Play
- `makeSelection(uint _poolId, PlayerChoice _choice)`: Allows a player to make their round selection.
- `roundResult(uint _poolId, uint _round)`: Determines round winners and losers.
- `concludeRound(uint _poolId, uint _round)`: Allows the owner to conclude a round manually if necessary.

### Winner Tracking
- `getRoundWinners(uint _poolId, uint _round)`: Returns the winners of a specific round.
- `getRoundLosers(uint _poolId, uint _round)`: Returns the losers of a specific round.

## Access Control
- **Owner-only functions**: Pool creation and manual round conclusion require `onlyOwner`.
- **Modifiers**: `poolExists(_poolId)` ensures valid pool access.

## Events
- `PoolCreated(poolId, entryFee, maxParticipants)`: Emitted when a pool is created.
- `PlayerJoined(poolId, player)`: Emitted when a player joins a pool.
- `PoolActivated(poolId)`: Emitted when a pool reaches max participants and becomes active.
- `RoundCompleted(poolId, round, winningSelection)`: Emitted when a round is concluded.
- `RoundWinners(poolId, round, winners)`: Emitted with round winners.
- `RoundLosers(poolId, round, losers)`: Emitted with round losers.
- `PoolCompleted(poolId, prizePool)`: Emitted when a pool concludes and final winners are determined.

## Notes
- The contract utilizes Chainlink VRF for randomness in case of ties.
- Prize distribution and claiming mechanisms are not included in the provided contract snippet.

# CoinToss Smart Contract Test Suite

## Overview
This repository contains the test suite for the `CoinToss` smart contract, implemented using Foundry's Solidity testing framework. The tests verify the core functionalities of the contract, ensuring that pool creation, player participation, selection-making, and prize claiming work as expected.

## Prerequisites
- Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to run the tests.
- Ensure that the `CoinToss.sol` contract is correctly placed in the `src` directory.

## Running Tests
To execute the tests, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
forge test
```

## Test Cases

### 1. `test_CreatePool()`
**Description:** Verifies that a pool is created successfully with the correct parameters.

**Assertions:**
- Entry fee and maximum participants are set correctly.
- The initial pool state is `OPENED`.
- Prize pool and current participants are zero.
- Maximum winners are set to `2`.

### 2. `test_JoinPool()`
**Description:** Ensures that a player can join a pool by paying the entry fee.

**Assertions:**
- The number of participants increases after joining.
- The prize pool is updated correctly.

### 3. `test_MakeSelection()`
**Description:** Validates the selection-making process during the game.

**Assertions:**
- The pool status updates to `ACTIVE` when enough players join.
- Players can make selections.
- The correct winner is determined.
- The pool status updates to `CLOSED` after the round ends.

### 4. `test_ClaimPrize()`
**Description:** Ensures that a winner can claim their prize after winning the game.

**Assertions:**
- The winner's balance increases correctly.
- The prize pool is distributed properly.
- Players cannot claim the prize twice.

### 5. `testRevert_JoinClosedPool()`
**Description:** Ensures that players cannot join a pool that has already reached the participant limit.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Reverts with an appropriate error message when trying to join a closed pool.

# CoinToss Deployment Script

## Overview
This script deploys the `CoinToss` smart contract and initializes multiple betting pools with different entry fees and participant limits.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed and configured before running the script:
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) (for `forge` and `cast` commands)
- A valid Ethereum private key set as an environment variable (`PRIVATE_KEY`)

## Deployment Steps
   ```sh
   forge script script/CoinTossScript.s.sol --rpc-url <your-rpc-url> --broadcast
   ```

## Script Functionality
- Retrieves the deployer's private key from the environment variables.
- Deploys the `CoinToss` smart contract.
- Creates multiple betting pools with predefined entry fees and participant limits.
- Logs contract deployment and pool creation details.

## Pool Configurations
| Pool ID | Entry Fee (ETH) | Max Participants |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| 0       | 0.01          | 5                |
| 1       | 0.02          | 10               |
| 2       | 2             | 20               |
| 3       | 10            | 100              |
| 4       | 5             | 50               |
| 5       | 0.02          | 10               |
| 6       | 0.03          | 5                |

## Notes
- Ensure your Ethereum wallet has enough funds to cover deployment and transaction fees.
- Modify the script as needed to adjust pool parameters.
- Double-check that the private key is set securely and not exposed in public repositories.


# Coin Toss Interaction and Pool Creation Script

## Overview
This repository contains two Solidity scripts used to interact with the Coin Toss smart contract. The first script, `CoinTossInteraction.sol`, facilitates a simulated interaction where multiple players join a Coin Toss game pool, make selections, and claim their winnings. The second script, `DeployInteractionScript.sol`, is used to deploy and interact with an already deployed Coin Toss contract.

## Files
1. **CoinTossInteraction.sol**:
   - Deploys the `CoinToss` contract.
   - Creates a game pool with a predefined entry fee and max participants.
   - Simulates multiple players joining the pool and making selections.
   - Processes game rounds until winners are determined.
   - Allows winners to claim their prizes.

2. **DeployInteractionScript.sol**:
   - Connects to an already deployed `CoinToss` contract.
   - Creates a new game pool on the existing contract.

## Prerequisites
- Foundry (`forge`) installed
- A configured development environment

## Running the Scripts
### 1. Running `CoinTossInteraction.sol`
```sh
forge script script/CoinTossInteraction.sol --fork-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

### 2. Running `DeployInteractionScript.sol`
```sh
forge script script/DeployInteractionScript.sol --fork-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

## Key Features
- Simulates a game where players choose between HEADS or TAILS.
- Tracks active participants and game rounds.
- Ends the game when winners are determined.
- Allows players to claim their winnings.

## Notes
- Ensure that you replace `<RPC_URL>` and `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with your actual test network RPC and private key.
- The Coin Toss contract must be deployed before running `DeployInteractionScript.sol`.
